# PomodoroApp
This app is a clone of a PomoFocus.io page. It is an example of more advanced Todo List. 
It contains a clock, to do list, and a timer that is calculating possible time of ending your tasks.

Page uses LocalStorage for all li elements and its properties, all settings are also being saved in local storage.

My greatest challenge during development of this applicaton were: 
- how to create timer with so many posibilities (adding task when finished, auto starting breaks or not depending on settings choosen,
auto starting tasks or not depending on settings choosen, starting long break after few smaller breaks, using ticking sound during task so it fits the timer);
- how to store data in local storage (it was my first time I used it in application), especially how to store li elements, and how to render them with stored data;
- how to prevent data of li elements in local storage to be overwritten by new li elements;
- how to check mark li elements and delete only thoose checked;

During development I improve my skills a lot in reading documentation and looking for answers on StackOverflow;

This was my first application that uses Javascript in such a large range, but definitely it wont be the last one.
